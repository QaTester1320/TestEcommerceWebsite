# TestEcommerceWebsite
This is a test e-commerce website for manual and automation testing

You can create a new account and sign in for only that moment. After visiting the website again, your login details are removed. We only store data for as long as you use it.

After that, you have to create a new account again..

We will fix this functionality soon...

There are two versions of this website: the one above, as I told you...

And the second one, where you can log in using any Gmail account and password for that time, there is no sign-up feature on that website, but some functionalities are not available.
